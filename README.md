# ClassGradeSorter
Created a program to help an accounting professor report/verify grades sorting by Student IDs and Total Points.

** NOTE
Student information remained confidenential; all original student IDs were randomized in the input file. Only the professor was aware of the original student ID-randomized student ID pairs.
